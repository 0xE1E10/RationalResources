# Rational Resources EL Utilities

## EL CRP
Authored by VeronikaKerman. This optional modlet forces Extraplanetary Launchpads' parts, patches and recipes to ignore or cancel the use of that mod's own resources (MetalOre, Metal) and substitute with MetallicOre and Metals (from Community Resource Pack). This modlet piggybacks on VeronikaKerman's pull request (as of Rational Resources release 1.4.0) which forces Rational Resources to do the same substitution to aid its compatibility with Kerbalism and Community Resource Pack on the whole.

## EL SystemHeat
This modlet adapts any part that uses EL's converter module to use the System Heat mod's variant resource converter module and interact with System Heat loops.
