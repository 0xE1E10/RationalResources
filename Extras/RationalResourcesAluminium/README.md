# Rational Resources Aluminium
This modlet enables the Aluminium tank type in propellant tanks empowered by RR's TankSwitchForSquad. It is also the trigger for any non-Kerbalism converter processes that involve EL's Metal resource to involve CRP Aluminium instead. This also triggers RR's demo hybrid SRBs to use Aluminium and not Metal resource.
