# Rational Resources Squad
Contained in `RR_SquadTanks.cfg` this mod is essential for flexibility with the stock propellant tanks and any mod's tanks that use the stock manufacturers. Its presence is required by other Rational Resources patches such as `RR_MoreTankSwitches.cfg` which adds RR options to tanks of other parts mods after they have been given B9 fuel switching by the CryoTanks mod.

`RR_TankswitchFusionFuel.cfg` provides for adding options for LqdDeuterium and LqdHe3 to Squad's tanks when CryoTanks is not installed, adding these to the CryoTanks themselves, and coloring the subtype options for these in Far Future Tech's fusion fuel tanks.

`RR_SquadJetsCRP.cfg` and `RR_SquadJetsClassic.cfg` provide for enabling the high-performance stock jet engines (the Whiplash, Panther and Rapier) to choose between LiquidFuel, LqdHydrogen or LqdMethane. This is for players who would like to mix and match the stock engines with CryoEngine's rockets but are deterred by the need to carry both LiquidFuel and any cryofuel on the same vessel.
