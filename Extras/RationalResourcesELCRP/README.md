# RationalResources EL-CRP

Authored by VeronikaKerman. This optional modlet forces Extraplanetary Launchpads' parts, patches and recipes to ignore or cancel the use of that mod's own resources (MetalOre, Metal) and substitute with MetallicOre and Metals (from Community Resource Pack). This modlet piggybacks on VeronikaKerman's pull request (as of RationalResources 1.4.0) which forces RationalResources to do the same substitution to aid its compatibility with Kerbalism and Community Resource Pack on the whole.

Compatibility with, or the use of the two non-CRP resources is hard deprecated and expected to lead to some discomfort in gameplay.
