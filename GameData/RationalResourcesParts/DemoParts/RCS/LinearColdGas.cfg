	description = It took Kenron several months after developing its nuclear rockets, rockets which could burn so many gases, to realize that RCS that could do the same and didn't need to be nuclear to do it, would be equally welcome and necessary for space craft. Kenron's public relations department announced that this delay was the effect of poor profits affecting the R&D division, however, some believe that the reason was the heads of Kenron were sleeping in their offices.
