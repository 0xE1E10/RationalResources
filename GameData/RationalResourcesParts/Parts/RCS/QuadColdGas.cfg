	description = It took Kenron's engineers several months after developing their nuclear rockets, rockets which could burn so many gases, to realize that RCS that could do the same would be eually welcome and necessary. Kenron's public relations department announced that this delay was the effect of poor profits affecting the R&D division, however, some believe that the reason was the heads of Kenron were sleeping in their offices.
