	@RESULTS
	{
		GrannusInSpaceHigh = Scan inconclusive. Baseline measurements for Sun stellar medium saved. Report saved.
		GrannusInSpaceLow = Star classification: Population 1. Metallicity rating: High. Antimatter presence is weak.
		
		TaranisInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Vulcan. The surface is very abundant in Mineral forms, natural combustibles, and organic materials.
		TaranisInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		ToutatisInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This planet is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		ToutatisInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Thin Ice-Water. Contrary to its name, only Carbon Dioxide is present, with a trace of free Oxygen. It is presumed to have been more Terra-like but all the lighter materials were stripped off by an anomalous event.
		
		NodensInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This planet is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		NodensInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Terra. Trace atmosphere classification: Terra. Farming opportunities available near atmosphere edge.
		
		BelisamaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Mun. This moon is inexplicably rich in metals and bound Oxygen.
		BelisamaInSpaceLow = Belisama has a modest store of metals, Minerals, Rock and Gypsum behind its blanket of Oxygen. Detecting highly scattered, highly dense concentrations of Water and rare materials. Further scanning is required. Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		SucellusInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This body is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		SucellusInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		CaireenInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This body is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		CaireenInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		SironaInSpaceHigh = Atmosphere classification: Uranian. Immense presence of Hydrogen and Helium. Detecting trace Ammonia and Methane. Hydrogen farming can proceed at great distance from the atmosphere edge.
		SironaInSpaceLow = Detecting Carbonaceous and Hydro type materials... Inconclusive. Atmosphere scattering too intense. Cannot probe surface... 		
		
		AirmedInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This moon is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		AirmedInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		BrovoInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This moon is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		BrovoInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Ice-Water. Contrary to the name, there is no water, however, Nitrogen itself and Hydrogen-rich compounds do remain.<br>Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		DamonaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This moon is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		DamonaInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		EponaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates. Crustal Oxygen found but with much less abundance than in the Mun.
		EponaInSpaceLow = Atmosphere classification: Ice-Water. Contrary to the name, there is no water, however, Nitrogen itself and Hydrogen-rich compounds do remain.<br>Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.
		
		RosmertaInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock-Ice. The crust primarily contains Rock and Hydrates. Crustal Oxygen found but with much less abundance than in the Mun.
		RosmertaInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		RAB-58EInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Rock. This body is very rich in Rock and Silicates, with tiers of even proportions of many other materials.
		RAB-58EInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere detected: Rock. There is an abundance of free Carbon Dioxide, Rock dust, and a potential presence of Helium, Oxygen and Water.
		
		CernunnosInSpaceHigh = Surface classification: Ice-Nitrogen. Detecting great abundance of crustal Nitrogen and Water. Detecting some life-bearing materials... Proportion of Rock is among the lowest observed yet...
		CernunnosInSpaceLow = Trace atmosphere classification: Ice. Detecting Nitrogen and Water in nearby space... Detecting Exotics and Nitrogen... Unable to detect metals and radioactives.
