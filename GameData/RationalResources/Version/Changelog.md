# Rational Resources

## 0.8.5
* Added parts:
  * ZZZ box Convert-O-Trons (will hold OmniConverters in Classic Stock mode).
  * HECS-shaped resource scanners.
  * Exo scoop.
* Added features:
  * Atmosphere harvester and splashed-only intake modules to the stock XM-G50 radial intake.
  * Resource options to the stock Drill-O-Matics.
  * Mini Convert-O-Tron and Drill-O-Matic are no longer borderline unplayable. They are as terrible as they are on purpose and some of us don't like that.  
  * LqdCO2 secondary mode for stock NERV. Requires ReStock.
* No longer add resource scanners to stock parts (the ones that will still appear in the Surface Scanner are those added by CRP, not this mod).
* Added Easy Mode. This prevents deletion of the stock fuel options in the Convert-O-Trons and causes Ore to not be nerfed as harshly. Ore remains available everywhere but will not pass 8% max (vs the default 15%).
* Buffed Minerite/Mineral abundance in Duna. Reduced RareMetal abundance in exchange.
